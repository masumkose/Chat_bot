A bond is a debt instrument where an investor lends money to an entity (typically a corporation or government). In return for the loan, the issuer pays the investor periodic interest (called a coupon) and repays the principal amount at the end of a specified term (maturity). Bonds are generally considered lower-risk than stocks and provide a more predictable income stream.
