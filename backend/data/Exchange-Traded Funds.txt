An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that holds a basket of assets—such as stocks, bonds, or commodities—and is traded on a stock exchange just like a regular stock. ETFs often track a specific index, like the S&P 500. They are popular due to their low costs, tax efficiency, and the flexibility of being traded throughout the day. They provide an easy way to achieve diversification.```
