A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company and entitles the owner to a claim on the company's assets and earnings. Stockholders can receive dividends (a share of the profits) and can realize a capital gain if the value of the stock increases. Stocks offer the potential for high returns but carry a higher risk compared to bonds.
