One of the most fundamental principles in finance is diversification. This principle is best summarized by the adage, "don't put all your eggs in one basket." The purpose of diversification is to prevent a major loss to the entire portfolio if a single asset or sector performs poorly. Risk is reduced by spreading investments across different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.
